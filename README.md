# Directory Management System

This is a simple directory management system implemented in C++. It allows you to add, delete, list, update, and find people in a directory.

## Features

1. **Add New Person**: This feature allows you to add a new person to the directory. You will be prompted to enter the name, surname, and phone number of the new person.

2. **Delete Person**: This feature allows you to delete a person from the directory. You will be shown a list of people in the directory and you can select a person to delete by their number.

3. **List and Update**: This feature shows you a list of all people in the directory. After showing the list, you will be asked if you want to update any person's details. If you choose to update, you will be prompted to select a person and enter their new details.

4. **Find Person**: This feature allows you to find a person in the directory by their surname.

## Usage

Compile the C++ file and run the executable. You will be shown a welcome screen with options to choose from. Select an option by entering the corresponding number. Follow the prompts to use each feature.
